INTRODUCTION
=============

The classic, graphical game of Hangman, intuitively taking advantage of the scarcely used 
multi-screen feature of the TI OS.  One person enters in a word, and then other(s) try to 
guess letters within the word to guess the whole word.  If they don't guess in time, a little 
dude will get hung!  Fun, compact, graphical!  -- By Fisch2

1) Send the AHANGMN2.83p file to your calculator

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

The game is pretty much self-explanatory, but I caution you NOT to exit the game by pressing 
ON.  You will still be in split-screen mode!  If this happens, you must go to MODE, and 
scroll to the very bottom where Horiz will be selected.  You need to change this to Full on the 
left (highlight it and press Enter).  Other than that, have fun with this game ;-)
