INTRODUCTION
=============

An original game in which you must progress through levels of increasing difficulty by navigating 
yourself to the other end of the cave.  You start at the left, constantly traveling right, and gravity pulls 
you down, but by tapping a button you get upwards propulsion.  Avoiding obstacles and the sides of 
the cave while competing for a high score, this game will quickly test your nerves and the quickness 
of your reflexes.  Certainly a unique and fast-paced gameplay experience.  -- By Fisch2

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

The default propulsion key is 2nd, but it is redefinable via the main menu.  Basically, you start 
on the left side of the screen and are moving right.  If you don't press 2nd at all, you will 
fall down and hit the side of the cave.  You need to tap 2nd to keep yourself level, but don't tap 
it too quickly or you'll give yourself too much propulsion and go skyrocketing into the top of the 
cave.  In later levels, you will need to hone your tapping to precisely avoid the increasing number 
of obstacles.
If the gameplay sounds confusing, just try it once.  It's not too difficult to figure out.
HINT:  When obstacles appear directly in front of your starting position, you can avoid them by 
tapping 2nd during the obstacle loading/drawing period, before you start moving.
