INTRODUCTION
=============

Calculates the real zeroes of a given function in the form of Ax^n + Bx^(n-1) +...+ Cx^0.  
Shows the work graphically as well. -- By Fisch2


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============

1) Send the A1ROOTS.83p file to your calculator
2) Run the A1ROOTS program (listed under the PRGM key)

Compatibility Notes:

* Supported calculators include:  TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, and the TI-84 Plus/SE
* This program is written in TI-Basic and is compatible with MirageOS


=============
INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Just enter in the coefficients of the function you want to calculate the roots for.  For example, 
9x^3+2x+1
You would enter 9,0,2,1
Be sure to enter the 0 as a placeholder for 0x^2.
The program will then show you the possible roots, graphically work them out, and then display 
the actual roots.
