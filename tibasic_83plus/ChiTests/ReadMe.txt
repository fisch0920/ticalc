INTRODUCTION
=============

Very useful Statistical program, covering the Goodness of fit and Chi squared tests.  Features 
include stating and checking for assumptions, displaying chi squared value, P-value, and degrees 
of freedom, tells you whether or not to reject the Ho hypothesis and at what alpha level, and does 
so in a very accurate, compact manner.  If you are taking AP Statistics or any math class which 
uses these distribution tests, you will find this program extremely useful, even if it's just to check 
your work. -- By Fisch2


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============

1) Send the CHITESTS.83p file to your calculator
2) Run the CHITESTS program (listed under the PRGM key)

If you need help sending the program to your calculator, please consult the ticalc.org tutorial 
first before emailing me questions -- located here:  http://www.ticalc.org/basics/linking/

Compatibility Notes:

* Supported calculators include:  TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, and the TI-84 Plus/SE
* This program is written in TI-Basic and is compatible with MirageOS

INSTRUCTIONS (assumes you have a basic knowledge of these tests)
=============

Goodness of Fit Test:
Store the hypothesized percents in L1, and the Sample Frequency in L2.  For the hypothesized 
percents, you do not need to enter them in as decimals.  For example, for 20%, you could put 
in .20 or just 20.  Just be consistent with the way you input the percents.  The assumptions will 
be displayed (along with whether or not the data passes these assumptions), then the statistical 
values will be displayed.  The Chi squared amounts will be stored into L3 if you need them to 
show your "work".  Then, the program will evaluate the P-value to determine whether or not you 
should accept or reject the null hypothesis, and at what alpha level.

Chi squared Test:
Store the observed data in Matrix A.  The expected amounts will be stored by the program into 
Matrix B, and the Chi squared amounts will be stored into Matrix C (they will also be displayed 
on the screen during the test).  Then, the appropriate statistical values will be displayed, and 
finally, the program will use the P-value to determine whether or not you should accept or reject 
the null hypothesis, and at what alpha level.

Please note that this program is incompatible with the AP Statistics Exam qualifications, because 
it displays the assumptions and infers from the data whether or not you should accept/reject the 
null hypothesis.  Therefore, you are not allowed to use this program on the exam, and have been 
fairly warned by the author.
