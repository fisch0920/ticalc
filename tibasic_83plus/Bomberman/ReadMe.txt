This is a graphical TI-Basic game for the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, and the TI-84 Plus/SE calculators.  The objective of the game is to progress through as many levels as you can, blowing up "Dirty Joe" and making it to the exit.  There are two different level types (big and small blocks), multiple difficulty settings, and an unlimited possibility of random levels.  There are also in-game instructions, so this readme will be short.

The current difficulty (changed via the main menu) will determine how many times you have to hit the animated Dirty Joe creature before it dies and you can easily make it to the Exit in the Lower Right of the Level.  Be careful, though, not to blow yourself up or the Exit!!!  Hope you have fun:)

The bombs will go off shortly after you lay them, but if you would like them to go off quicker, press CLEAR to explode them.  Also, you may not walk back through a bomb once you have set it, so think carefully about where you place the bombs.  You have a limited number of bombs, but with each level you beat, you win more.

I made this game a long time ago when I first started programming, but it is definitely an excellent game for TI-Basic.  In my (biased) opinion, it is one of the best TI-basic games available.  Currently, I am programming in C/assembly for the 68k calcs.
