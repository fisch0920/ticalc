INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Most of the game is fairly self-explanatory, so here's a few things to get you started:

Use the arrow keys to move your animated cursor around the blocks.  Press 2nd or Enter to 
select a block.  Your goal is to match all of the corresponding characters concealed under the 
blocks.  That is where the recall/memory part comes in.  If you turn over two blocks and they 
are not a match, you must remember what they were, so that when you eventually come across 
a matching character, you can match them up right away.  Also, be aware that you can 'wrap 
around' the board in a sense with your cursor.  For example, if you move off the board to the 
left, your cursor will show up on the far right side.  This really comes in handy for some of the 
larger board sizes.  As far as high scores go:  you're aiming for LOW scores, that is, you are 
trying to complete the board by flipping over as few blocks as possible.
Pressing CLEAR at any time during gameplay will exit and prompt you to save the game.
