Run  Version 1.0

Run is a simple game where you control a smiley face and move around the screen, trying to evade the four deadly ships.  The ships gradually get faster and faster until you eventually crash and watch yourself explode.  This is a fun little game, but I also hope it will help somebody to learn C, as I have just started learning myself.

	This is the final version of Run because I am working on other projects right now.  Feel free to edit or take the source code, because the game is really meant as a learning step for me.

This game is pretty self explanatory, but if you have any questions or comments, my e-mail is:

In the next week or so, I will be releasing about a 10 level demo of an awesome strategy game, called Strategery.  The game is far superior to Run, and on some levels it took me more than an hour to beat.
  In Strategery, you are a mouse and have to move blocks in order to trap various ghosts on many levels.  However, there are some blocks that you can't move and the ghosts are very smart.  This game, when done, will be VERY hard.  The higher levels in the demo are fairly tough, but when I release the full version, there will be levels on it which I can't even beat.  I have also started work on an Excitebike clone, which won't be ready to play for a long time yet.  The graphics are the hardest to make in a game, since I'm not an artist and if anyone has any suggestions for me about how to go about drawing sprites and such, please e-mail me.  I really need help in that department.  Anyway, run is a pretty fun game that you should try at least once.
