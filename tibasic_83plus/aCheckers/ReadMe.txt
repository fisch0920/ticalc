INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Most of the game is fairly self-explanatory, but here a few things to help you get started:

All normal rules of Checkers apply and are checked by the program.
Kings are denoted by filling in a piece's middle (easy to tell the difference).  Only Kings may 
move backwards.
During gameplay, press DEL to access an Exit menu, where you will have the option of saving 
your game to be loaded at a later time.
Note:  If you exit the game by breaking it with ON, your Graph screen may look funny.  It is 
recommended that you not exit the game this way because the program will not be able to 
clean itself up.
