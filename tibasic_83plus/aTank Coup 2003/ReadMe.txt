INTRODUCTION
=============

Battle against one or more friends over a wide variety of customizable terrains that will react 
realistically to your weapons.  Select from different weapons and powerup and then take turns 
blowing the crap out of your friends!  The absolute best TI-Basic Tank game of its type!
Awesome graphics and multiplayer gameplay, just take a look at the screenshots.  -- By Fisch2


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============

1) Send the A1TANKS.83p file to your calculator
2) Run the A1TANKS program (listed under the PRGM key)

* Supported calculators include:  TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, and the TI-84 Plus/SE
* This program is written in TI-Basic and is compatible with MirageOS
* You may have to archive other programs to run this program


=============
INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Most of the game is fairly self-explanatory, but here a few things to help you get started:

*In the Shop Menu, where you buy your weapons, press CLEAR after you are done buying 
to move on to the next player.*
Buying Defense 'armor' is definitely a good idea.
Use the '2nd' key if Enter doesn't work for selection in menues.
My favorite terrain is number 1, but go ahead and try all of them out -- it's fun!
For the terrains which ask you for a terrain level, the higher the number you input, the less 
terrain there will be (the more white space).
Ingame:
Press MODE to switch weapons (if you bought more than one type).  Press Left/Right to aim 
your cursor, and Up/Down to change the Power of the shot.  Press +/- to increase/decrease 
the power by intervals of 10.  The current tank's health is depicted by both the number at the 
top, center of the screen, and also the health bar underneath the numbers.  Press CLEAR to 
pause the game and bring up options such as saving the current game, starting a new game, 
or exiting.

CREDITS
========

This program was written by Travis Fischer (Fisch2).  There is an older version of Tanks which 
helped me out when writing this program, but since I wrote this program so long ago, I'm not 
really sure.  Feel free to check out the source, but be sure to give credit if you use any of it.
Though I was quite inexperienced at the time of writing Tanks, it is still very well optimized for 
a program of its complexity.
