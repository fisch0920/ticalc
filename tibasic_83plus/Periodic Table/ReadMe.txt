INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Move around the periodic table by using the arrow keys.  Pressing 2nd or Enter will bring up an 
information screen about the selected element (selected elements will then be marked afterwards 
for ease of reference).  Pressing MODE will bring you back to the main menu.  Press CLEAR 
to exit the program.
In the element search, you don't have to enter the entire name.  Just enter a few letters, such as 
HYD, which would bring up Hydrogen.  Other than that, this program's pretty much self-
explanatory.
