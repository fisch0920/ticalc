INTRODUCTION
=============

A 2D graphical rendition of a put-putt type mini-golf game.  To my knowledge, the only TI Basic 
game of its type. -- By Fisch2


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============

1) Send the AGOLF.83p file to your calculator
2) Run the AGOLF program (listed under the PRGM key)

Compatibility Notes:

* Supported calculators include:  TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, and the TI-84 Plus/SE
* This program is written in TI-Basic


=============
INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Use the arrow keys to move your aiming cursor around the course.  The hole is the large thingy 
on the right.  Press Enter to confirm your trajectory angle.  Then, use the Up/Down keys to select 
your desired power, and press Enter again to shoot the ball.  The ball will bounce off objects, 
including the walls and the hold (so don't hit the ball into the hole too hard).
This game is really just a tech example.
