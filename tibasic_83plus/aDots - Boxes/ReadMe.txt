INTRODUCTION
=============

The classic game of Dots (aka Boxes), popularized by the pencil & paper version, where 
two or more people take turns connecting a grid of dots with lines in an attempt to form 
complete boxes.  The player who completes the most boxes wins!  Features include:  2-9 
players, customizable grid width/height, extremely intuitive game controls, and even a 
preview cursor which shows the user what a line would look like if placed in the current 
position.  Without any doubt, the best TI Dots game available.  If you're looking for a 
quality multiplayer puzzle game, you will definitely not be disappointed! -- By Fisch2

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

After selecting the number of players and grid width/height, each player will take turns moving 
an animated cursor line over the grid, placing lines in strategic places.  Press Up/Down and 
Left/Right to move the cursor (very easy once you get used to it!), and press 2nd to lay down 
your line.  Your cursor animates to show you a preview of what a line would look like if placed 
there.  If you scroll your cursor on top of a line that already exists, it will blink to show you that 
you cannot place a line there.  Once a player forms a box, his/her number will be displayed 
inside of that box.  The player who has completed the most of these boxes when the grid is filled 
up will be the winner.  Have fun!
