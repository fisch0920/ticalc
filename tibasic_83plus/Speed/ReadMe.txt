INTRODUCTION
=============

A very fun twist on the classic snake-like game, in which you must progress through various 
levels of increasing difficulty by navigating your snake to the top of a maze, avoiding obstacles 
and competing for a high score along the way. -- By Fisch2


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============

1) Send the SPEED.83p file to your calculator
2) Run the SPEED program (listed under the PRGM key)

first before emailing me questions -- located here:  http://www.ticalc.org/basics/linking/

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Use the arrow keys to move your snake around, just like in a classical snake-type game.  Your 
starting position is denoted by an up arrow.  Once the obstacles are done being drawn, press 
any of the arrow keys to begin moving.  Avoid the obstacles and the sides of the path in an 
attempt to make it to the top of the screen.  With each progressive level, there will be more 
obstacles, and thus, more of a challenge.Overall, this is simply a fun game and can get quite 
challenging if you stick with it.

so many years ago, and it is still dear to me.  I know it could probably be optimized quit a bit, 
but there are some things which should just be left alone..
