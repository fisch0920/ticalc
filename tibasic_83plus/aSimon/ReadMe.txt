INTRODUCTION
=============

The classic Memory/Reflex game of Simon, brought to you graphically!!!  Features include:  
two modes (regular and messed up), two speed settings, fast and responsive gameplay, 
and an intuitive, graphical interface.  This game can be Very challenging.  If you're unfamiliar 
with Simon, basically the screen is divided up into 4 parts, and you must recall an 
increasingly deep pattern by using the arrow keys which correspond to the locations on the 
screen.  In messed up mode, the on-screen directions will appear in areas of the screen 
which don't correspond (such as the word "Up" appearing on the Left side, "Left" appearing 
on the right side, and so on).  This is, without a doubt, the best Simon-type memory game 
available for the TI calcs.  -- By Fisch2

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

After choosing the gameplay style and speed, a screen will appear that will divide itself into 
four different sections (each corresponding to the four arrow keys).  A series of directions 
will appear, which you must them repeat.  You will start off with one direction, then two, then 
three, and so on, as long as you continue to repeat the sequence correctly.  If you press 
the wrong key or wait too long, you will lose.  If you weren't paying attention, you will lose.  
If you throw your calculator against the wall, you will lose and I am not liable to be sued ;-)
The messed up mode is really, really tough.  Directions will appear on the screen in a random 
spot and will not appear in the same spot each time.  You really have to be concentrating to 
do well in this mode.  Viel glück!
The speed setting determines how fast the directions appear on the screen.  Faster is harder.
On both speeds, however, the longer the sequence gets, the directions will automatically 
begin to get faster (up to a certain point where it can't get any faster).
