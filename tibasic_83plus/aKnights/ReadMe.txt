INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Use the arrow keys to move your cursor around the grid.  Press 2nd to confirm a spot to move 
your Knight to.  Once you've landed on a spot, it turns black and you will be unable to land there 
again.  The key is to develop a patterned strategy in the beginning and stick to it, otherwise you'll 
have just a couple of spots left which you'll be unable to move to.  Pressing CLEAR at any time 
during gameplay will exit the game.
