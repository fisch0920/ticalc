Take turns with a friend, trying to get your Racko cards in the correct order.  An intriguing, 
graphical rendition of the excellent, classic card game.  If you're looking for Racko (or if 
you've never heard of it..), then look no further! -- By Fisch2

INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Attempt to order your racko side sequentially, in descending order from top to bottom.  Each 
turn, you can choose from the discard pile or draw a random card to replace with one of your 
own (that card will then go to the discard pile).  You and another player take turns doing this 
until one of you gets your side all in descending order.
Racko was originally a card game that I played when I was younger (not sure of its origins).
