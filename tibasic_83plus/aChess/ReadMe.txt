INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Much of the game is self-explanatory, but here's a few things to get you started:

Use the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move your cursor around the board.  When you move 
over top of a piece, its truncated name will appear on the right-hand side (i.e. pawn, rook, 
knigh, etc).  Press 2nd to select and a piece and 2nd again to place it somewhere.  The 
text in the lower right of the screen tells you whose turn it is and gives other information.  
The program checks for almost all legal moves.  Currently, there is no automated checking/
checkmating; just call it yourself.  Once you get to checkmate, just kill the King for the 
game to be over.  Press MODE ingame to bring up a menu including options for Castling, 
Undoing moves, saving, and exiting.
The only other not-so-obvious point is the Random Start Mode, where you select which 
types of pieces will be used, and the game will randomly generate a board for you to play 
on.  Results can be interesting...
