INSTRUCTIONS
=============

Each player has to pluck blocks from one of the five rows.  You can only pluck from one row per 
turn.  Basically, use the arrow keys to move around the grid, and the 2nd key to pluck a block.  
You can pluck up to five blocks in a row during your turn, but you must pluck at least one.  Press 
CLEAR to end your turn.  Then, the next player goes and plucks up to five blocks in a row during 
his/her turn.  This continues until there is one block left, and the player who is made to pluck it is 
the loser.  Just try playing it once if this sounds confusing.
Press DEL to exit the game at any time.
