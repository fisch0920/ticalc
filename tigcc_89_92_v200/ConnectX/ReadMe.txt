     Connectx is written in C, using tigcc.  It is very simple to learn if you have ever played Connect4 before, or even if you haven't.  Basically, you are not limited to just dropping tiles from the top to the bottom, but you can also drop them from the right, going left; from the left, going right; and from the bottom, falling up.	     This may sound confusing, but soon you will find out how EASY it is to play.  This game is definitely a strategic game which takes lots of planning.  This game is very fun, and I hope you like it as much as I do.
