Gun!!!!  Version 1.0

--By Fisch

Take your frustration out on your screen with your handy calculator gun!  Has three different weapons and on some parts of the screen, the bulletholes will stay after you leave the game!  This is a fun timewaster, but is not actually a game.

DISCLAIMER:

This program will not actually shoot holes in your calculator.  
Being an assembly game, there is always a chance of it messing up your calc, but it shouldn't cause I've tested it thoroughly.  Although, I am not responsible for anything that might happen to anything in the universe because of this program.  If your calc ever doesn't turn on, read your manual on what to do about it.

FUTURE:

In the next week or so, I will be releasing about a 10 level demo of an awesome strategy game, called Strategery.  The game is very hard, and on some levels it took me more than an hour to beat.  Some people that have played it say it reminds them of an old computer game where you trap cats or rats or something.
  In Strategery, you are a mouse and have to move blocks in order to trap various ghosts on many levels.  However, there are some blocks that you can't move and the ghosts are very smart.  This game, when done, will be VERY hard.  The higher levels in the demo are fairly tough, but when I release the full version, there will be levels on it which I can't even beat.  I have also started work on an Excitebike clone, which won't be ready to play for a long time yet.  The graphics are the hardest to make in a game, since I'm not an artist and if anyone has any suggestions for me about how to go about drawing sprites and such, please e-mail me.  I really need help in that department.
