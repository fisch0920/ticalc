Note--
I may complete rewrite Strategery to use large multidirectional scrolling levels, high scores, external levels and a level editor, and much much more if I get enough encouragement/E-mail.  HOME Quits the game instead of ESC, I don't remember why I did this :)  Other than that, use the arrows to move and 2nd to move through the menues.

Strategery is a very strategical game, that involves quick reflexes and lots of planning.  It is pretty simple.  You are the mouse and will always start in the upper left corner of the screen.  Your goal is to trap and vanquish ghosts on various levels.  You do this by pushing blocks to trap them.  It is like Rodent's Revenge, if you've ever played that before.  This program is not done because I have moved onto other projects.  The source is scattered and hard to follow because it was one of my first programs in C and I still had a lot of bad habits from Ti-basic.  Suggestions are very welcome.  There are no bugs that I know of.  If you find any, please let me know.

STORY MODE:
Battle your way through levels of increasing difficulty to make it to a bonus level at the end and claim victory for your mouse.  (I think you can get to the bonus level by holding the 6 and 9 keys, but I don't remember for sure).  It is all but impossible to get through all 40 levels with one life, but you can always try to prove me wrong.

//////////////////////////////// !!!
PRACTICE MODE:
//////////////////////////////// !!!
Choose a level to practice on.  I recommend this Mode first.  You can choose randomly by going to the left all the way past level 1.

CANNOTS-------

You cannot simply push a block onto a ghost to kill it.  The ghost will instinctively move out of the way, unless it cannot move and is trapped on all four sides by blocks.

You cannot move a certain type of block, shown in game.

CANS-------------

You can push as many blocks at a time, as long as where you are pushing the blocks to is empty.

You can beat every leve!  I know, because I have done it.

You can have fun.  I am giving you permission.


He-he!!

I programmed this game about a year ago and it was one of my first programs in C.  I would like to thank:
