May 27 -

* Improved the routine to establish a Link connection.  From now on, both calcs do not 
have to be running the Excitebike program when the first calc enters Multiplayer.  They 
don't even have to be connected with a cable.  Several people have had trouble trying to 
figure out why linkplay wouldn't work when entering Multiplayer on one calc before starting 
the game on the other.

connection routine
* Updated the game to v0.60

the full track, they sort of teleport in one direction or another when offscreen, 
so the user will always have Computer Bikes around

the Camera

spot repeatedly and get stuck there

tumble, without throwing the rider off
* Fixed a bug in the Jumping Physics
* Optimized a few Routines

January 2 -
* Working on Perfecting Jumping Physics for each type of Jump
* Figured out that the cosine and sine functions were returning the values in 
Radians instead of Degrees.  Man, I'm stupid.  Now the Jumping works MUCH 
Better.
* Changed to using a small LookUp Table instead of using the sin and cos 
functions (Much smaller and faster)
* Converted some of the Miscellaneous Graphics
