INTRODUCTION<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
=============<br>
<br>
This game is a clone of the well-known NES Excitebike dirtbike racing game.  Gameplay in <br>
Excitebike 68k is exactly the same as the original, as well as the Five built-in tracks.  <br>
This program was designed with the Ti-89, Ti-89 Titanium, Ti-92+, and v200 in mind, and the <br>
same program should run on all three calculators.  If needed, key information is provided <br>
in the game itself from the main menu's Info option.  Have fun with this game :)<br>
<br>
<br>

<font color="#ffcc00">
REQUIREMENTS<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
==============<br>
<br>
Send the two Excitebike files to your calculator and type excitebk() in the Home entry line <br>
to start.  It does not matter if you send the 89 files to your 92+ or the V2Z (v200) Files <br>
to an 89 (Unless you have a Ti-89 Titanium!).  The program is designed to detect which type <br>
of calculator it is being run on and the same program should run on all three calculators.  <br>
Just make sure that one of the files has a .z extension (ASM extension on calc) and the <br>
other has a .y (ppg extension on calc). <font color="#ffcc00"> If you have a Ti-89 Titanium<font color="#fffff">, 
you <font color="#ffcc00"> MUST<font color="#fffff"> send the <br>
appropriate Titanium launcher (instead of the .z file).  The Ti-89 Titanium launcher is <br>
incompatable with the Ti-89, Ti-92+, and v200 launcher.  Please note, that this program <br>
has yet to be tested on an actual Ti-89 Titanium, but in theory, it should work.<br>

<font color="#ffcc00">
General:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
--------<br>
<br>
Race against one to three Computer AI Bikes, a Friend, or alone in one of Five Built-In Tracks <br>
or a Custom, external track.  Avoid hazardous terrain and hit huge air on over twenty types of <br>
Terrain.  Each track has a Record best time and also a qualifying time necessary for you to <br>
take in the top 3 and qualify to advance on to harder races.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Default Keys (Same on all calculators):<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
---------------------------------------<br>
Up - Moves the bike up on the track<br>
Down -Moves the bike down on the track<br>
Left -Tilts the bike backwards<br>
Right -Tilts the bike forwards (only relevant when in the air)<br>
APPS -Pauses the game<br>
ESC -Quits the game<br>
Left and Down -When held in the air, it will perform a Backflip for a Time bonus!<br>
Right and Up -When held in the air, it will perform a Frontflip for a Time bonus!<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Calculator Specific Keys:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
Ti-89 / Ti-92+ / Ti-v200<br>
-----------------------<br>
2nd / F1 / Hand - Uses the slower gear for your bike, but it will not overheat you (Gas key)<br>
Shift / F5 / F1 - Uses the faster gear for your bike, but it can overheat you      (Turbo key)<br>
F5 / F4 / F3 - Teacher Key, Quits the game Fast<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Modes:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
------<br>
<br>
1) Race - Choose to race in any of Five built-in tracks.  If you finish in the top 3, you <br>
will advance on to the next Round/Track until you do not qualify.  You may also choose the <br>
option of Loading and Racing on an external Track, which you may not advance from.<br>
<br>
2) Multiplayer - Race against a Human opponent via the Link in a fast-paced one-on-one showdown!<br>
     a) Fastest Time - The person with the fastest time at the end of the race wins.  Note, that <br>
     this may not be the first person to finish the race since you can do backflips to lower <br>
     your time. (default)<br>
     b) First to Finish - The first person to cross the finish line wins, regardless of the <br>
     other player's time.<br>
See the Linkplay section of this Readme for more information on the Multiplayer mode.<br>
<br>
3) Track Editor - Build and customize your own Externally stored tracks and then race on them <br>
in either of the other two modes.  Editor options include Creating, Editing, and Deleting <br>
External Tracks.  In the Track Editor, the currently selected piece of Terrain will Blink.  <br>
Pressing Left or Right will move your cursor in the corresponding direction at the top of the <br>
screen.  Press the Gas key to place a Terrain and overwrite the currently selected blinking <br>
terrain.  Press the Turbo key to accept a terrain choice and scroll on to the next piece of <br>
Track.  You can scroll backwards along a Track by pressing the Backspace key (this will Not <br>
erase the track, it will just scroll the screen in the opposite direction).  Be creative by <br>
making your tracks challenging and adding twists to them.<br>
NOTE - In Multiplayer Mode, only the Host Calc (the one to join the game first) has to have <br>
the external level if you wish to race on it.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Two Player Info<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
----------------<br>
<br>
Make sure that both Calcs have the Excitebike Files and that the Link cable is connected <br>
firmly into both Calcs and then choose the 'Multiplayer' option in the Main Menu.  The <br>
Calculator which Joins the game first will become the Host, which, unless you are <br>
interested in the source, really doesn't matter.  Multiplayer games have been extensively <br>
tested, but there is no way to ensure a 100% connection rate.  There is a noticeable <br>
speed difference in the multiplayer games because of the large amounts of data that need <br>
to be transferred through the link each frame.  If there is a Link Error, just try again; <br>
most of the time it will work.  If one calc gets stuck waiting for the other calc to join <br>
when the other calc has already joined, there has been an error so ESC back and try it <br>
again.  If the problem persists, there may be a defect in your cable/connection.  Check <br>
again that the link cable is firmly connected to both calcs, and if the problem still <br>
hasn't gone away, you may need to archive everything on your calc and reset it.  Also, <br>
don't think that you have to both enter the Multiplayer option at the same time because it <br>
really doesn't matter as long as both calcs are running the Excitebike program.  Remember <br>
that when racing against computer or human opponents, you will crash if your front wheel <br>
collides with an opponent's rear wheel.  It is Very fun to play Excitebike with a friend <br>
so go try it!  It is especially fun to challenge friends with your own custom-made tracks.<br>
<br>
NOTE - In Multiplayer Mode, only the Host Calc (the one to join the game first) has to have <br>
the external level if you wish to race on it.  Also, you may want to check to make sure <br>
both calcs have the latest version of Excitebike.  Linkplay in Excitebike is backwards-<br>
compatible, but there is a rare chance that you may encounter connection problems if both <br>
calcs do not have the same version of Excitebike.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Cheats<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
-------<br>
<br>
After every race on Track 5 that your time is less than 50 seconds (with no cheats enabled), <br>
a message will be shown, notifying you of a new cheat.  You can enter cheats in the Options <br>
menu.  Each time you enter or reenter a cheat, you will either enable or disable it.  If <br>
you entered a cheat successfully, a message will be shown indicating which cheat you have <br>
enabled/disabled.  Cheats can be used in any game mode, but you will be unable to unlock <br>
new cheats if you have any turned on.<br>

HINTS and HELP<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
==============<br>
<br>
If you find Anything wrong with the game, you know a way to improve Excitebike, or you are <br>
just lonely, your e-mail is very welcome.  Please, no Spam or Junk e-mails.  If you would <br>
like to reuse a major portion of the source, please contact me first.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Hints:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
-----<br>
<br>
1) By either pressing Left or Right going INTO a jump, you can greatly change the type of <br>
jump you will have.  Pressing Back (Left) will give a shorter, higher Jump.  Pressing <br>
Forwards (Right) will give a longer, lower Jump.<br>
<br>
2) Pull off Backflips Only on jumps that have steeper slopes.  Even though you have more <br>
airtime on some of the longer jumps, you will have less backwards momentum/pull to finish <br>
your flip.  I have found that Tall Bumps, both Monster Jumps, and the Large Bump Terrains <br>
are the best to perform flips on.  Backflips look sweet and are also the *key* to qualifying <br>
on some of the harder courses.  With each Backflip you perform, Three precious seconds are <br>
taken off the clock, so get flipping.<br>
<br>
3) If in doubt when taking a jump, just let the bike fly as it wants to.  Often this will <br>
be a slower method of travel, but it will be an easier time landing.<br>
<br>
4) Lining your bikes angle up with the slope of the landing area.  This will make your <br>
transition from obstacle to obstacle easier and faster.<br>
<br>
5) Try to avoid getting stuck in a group of same speed opponents as they can pen you in.  <br>
This could be the difference between qualifying, and being eliminated.<br>
<br>
6) When designing a course, try to mix some harder challenges with easier ones to create <br>
a fun course for all.<br>
<br>
7) Run over Cool spots often so your bike will not overheat (Arrow marks on the Track).<br>
<br>
8) It helps to learn the track's contents!  Knowing where a cool spot is or whether or not <br>
to take a jump a certain way will really pay off.<br>
<br>
9) As in original Excitebike, Tapping Gas and/or Turbo while running back to your Bike after <br>
Crashing will greatly speed up the process and get you racing much sooner.<br>
<br>
10) If you are playing for a challenge, then multiple AI bikes are the best, but they will <br>
slow you down.  Every frame, the CPU has to update several bikes instead of just your one, <br>
so you will Not possibly be able to finish a race as fast as you would without having any <br>
Computer bikes.<br>

This program was written by me, Travis Fischer.  The graphics and tracks are all ripped <br>
from the original NES Excitebike.  There are in-game scrolling Credits in the Info option <br>
off of the Main menu.  I really have to give the biggest thanks to the Programming Message <br>
Board at http://pub26.ezboard.com/btichessteamhq.  I visit it often and always find quick, <br>
correct answers to my many questions.  If you are considering learning to program in C with <br>
TIGCC, then you should definitely visit that forum quite frequently.<br>
<br>
