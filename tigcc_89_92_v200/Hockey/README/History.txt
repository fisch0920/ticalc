HISTORY (2005)
---------------

December 30 -
* Fixed the following bug reported by Kevin Kofler by making the hidden gray planes one 
line larger:  "if the selected computer team contains a "g", the game will misbehave (the 
camera will jump like mad, the computer players will play stupidly and/or you'll not be 
able to hit the puck, the calculator may also crash at some later point). This is because 
the "g" is displayed in a way which overflows the plane (the last line is off-screen), 
overwriting some variables"
* Recompiled with the latest version of TIGCC (v0.95 Beta 6)
* Updated the game to v2.75
- Program Size: 54,983

March 7 -

* Began another period of private beta testing of v2.50

August 30 -
* Fixed a glitch in the Options Menu where the Team Editor option sometimes wouldn't appear

August 29 -
* Converted to using a new _KeyCheck system to shave off over 2,000 bytes!  (the new system 
was originally developed for Sumo Wrestling and since, I have incorporated it into both 
ExciteBike 68k and now Ice Hockey 68k)
* Slightly Optimized the Link exiting code (~150 bytes)
* Updated the code to establish a link connection to the routine I used for ExciteBike 
68k (now one calc can enter the Multiplayer option before the other is running the Ice 
Hockey program)
* Returned the external graphics data back into the main file
* Updated the program to v2.50

August 17 -
* Many !LARGE! optimizations have been made to Ice Hockey, reducing the uncompressed 
size by over 12,000 bytes!  Much thanks to Lionel Debroux who contributed/suggested 
all of them!  These include (may not be complete):
* the addition of several compiler switches
* not using builtin TIGCC double-buffering support
* converting large arrays of strings into an optimized assembly format
* updating to the latest ExtGraph beta and using Regparm versions of the routines
* linkplay now exchanges about 1/3 the amount of data each frame

July 22 -
* Received confirmation that Ice Hockey 68k v2.00 works on the Ti-89 Titanium 
from Dan Barr

July 18 -
* Recompiled Ice Hockey 68k with TIGCC v0.95 Beta 12, to add further 
optimizations and, more importantly, Ti-89 Titanium compatibility

January 1 -
* Changed to using FS_DrawString to draw strings Fast, instead of 
FS_DrawLittleString, which only supported F_4x6
* Fixed a Glitch in the Puck-Goal Hit Detection, where the puck would go in 
the net and score, but then be pushed up a few pixels so it would look like 
it shouldn't have scored
* Added an option to change the Game Speed
* Added three cheats

HISTORY (2003)
---------------

December 31 -
* Added Fast String Drawing (Beta Routines written by TICT).  The Game now 
runs SO FAST, that I can't even see the puck!

December 12 -
* Changed the menues to incorporate the Distortion effect in the background 
instead of the Menu Selection Bars; They were too hard to read when the text 
was swaying.
* The external hockteam File will only be saved now if the User has made 
changes
* It took me about a month, but I finally figured out why the Flower and 
LinkPlay Graphics crashed when they were loaded from the External File.  It 
is because they are unsigned long arrays and they were being loaded from 
an ODD memory Address in the File.  Once I made sure that their Address in 
the hockgfx File was Even, it worked fine:)

December 10 -
* Added the Squiggly Title Screen and Menu Selection Bars!

November 30 -

Menu, as well as 2nd;  Suggested by Jordan Krage
* Fixed a potentially serious bug, reported to me by Lionel Debroux, 
where if an error was thrown or ESC+ON is pressed with Kerno installed, 
the program would leak memory and fail to reinstall the original 
interrupt handlers.

November 7 -
* Converted all key values to the new Reconfigurable format
