UPDATING NOTES<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
================<br>
<br>
If you are updating from a previous version of Ice Hockey (below v2.70):<br>
<br>
1) There is no longer a need for the external graphics file 'hockgfx'.  If it is still <br>
located on your calculator, you may delete it.  All data which used to be located in this <br>
file has been moved back into the main program as a result of 15kb worth of optimizations!<br>
<br>
2) Linkplay in this version has been heavily optimized/updated, so it is incompatible with <br>
the linkplay of previous versions.  Before playing multiplayer, first make sure that both <br>
calcs have the same version of Ice Hockey (at least v2.71).  Linkplay in v2.71 should be <br>
more efficient and stable.<br>
<br>
3) Any configuration settings you had saved in an older version of Ice Hockey will be erased, <br>
but it is very easy to reset them.  Edited, external teams from previous versions will work <br>
fine with any version of Ice Hockey.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
=============<br>
<br>
I've always loved the game of Hockey and thought it would be fun to make a game of it.  This <br>
game was entirely created with TIGCC and needs approximately 85,000 bytes of available RAM <br>
for the game to run.  This program was designed with the Ti-89, Ti-92+ and v200 in mind and <br>
the same program should run on all three calculators.  To run the game on a Ti-89 Titanium, <br>
you must send the appropriate version, located in a separate folder marked 'Ti-89 Titanium'.<br>
This is a 3v3 Hockey game with no penalties.  If needed, key information is provided in the <br>
game itself from the main menu's Info option.  Have fun with this game :)<br>
<br>
<br>

<font color="#ffcc00">
REQUIREMENTS<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
==============<br>
<br>
1) Send the two hockey files to your calculator<br>
	* The file 'hockey' is the program launcher<br>
	* The file 'hoekcyzip' contains the compressed game code which is run by hockey()<br>
2) Type hockey() in the Home entry line<br>
3) Press ENTER to run the game<br>
4) There will be a very short pause while the game is decompressing.  This is normal and <br>
should last one to two seconds.<br>
<br>
Compatibility Notes:<br>
<br>
*Ice Hockey 68k needs about 80,000 bytes of free RAM to run.  To free up memory, you may<br> 
have to archive some files.  Go to the Var-Link menu (2nd -), choose a file (or more than <br>
one, using F4), then press F1 to open the Manage menu and press 8, 'Archive Variable' to <br>
archive files.<br>
<br>
* Sumo Wrestling should be compatible with all AMS versions 1.01 and greater, including <br>
the Titanium 3.00.  It should also run fine on PedroM.<br>
<br>
* The program is designed to detect which type of calculator it is being run on, so the same <br>
program will run on a Ti-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92+, or on a v200.  One of the files should <br>
have a .z extension (ASM extension on calc) and the other should have a .y (ppg extension on <br>
calc).<br>
<br>

General:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
--------<br>
<br>
During the game, the player that you control will have a hand pointing at it.  The Player who has <br>
control of the puck will have a large circle surrounding the Player.  Games are 3v3 with one <br>
Goalie on each team.  Each team is either in the Western of Eastern conference.  These are the <br>
real NHL's teams and Rosters.  Each team also has a type of formation.  With some practice, <br>
you should find which formations do well against others and which do not.  Each team then has <br>
three Players located at the top of the screen.  The first Player will always be a goalie.  There <br>
are then three other types of players, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.  <br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
Player Types:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
-------------<br>
<br>
1) Goalie     - Goalies will always stay in front of their goal and react to the action <br>
rather than taking part in it.  The Goalie's attributes are the same as an Average Plr.<br>
<br>
2) Fat        - This Players are slow and will easily be outskated by skinnier players.  <br>
However, they have a very hard shot and have a higher chance at winning the puck in a <br>
scramble.  I have found that the Fat Players are harder to play with, so if you get pretty <br>
good at Hockey, try playing with the Fat guys on Hard Difficulty.<br>
<br>
3) Average    - This Player is an average of the Fat and Skinny Players.  Average Players <br>
have no strengths and that is their weakness.<br>
<br>
4) Skinny     - These Players are very fast skaters, but have a softer shot.  They are also <br>
less likely to win the puck in a scramble.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffcc00">
There are four main Modes of Play:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
1) Exhibition - Hone your skills against a computer opponent or a friend in a single game.  <br>
Choosing the Calc vs Calc option will allow you to watch the Computer A.I. play itself.<br>
<br>
2) Tournament - Battle your way to the top of an eight team tournament.  To win, you must <br>
beat three computer teams successively.<br>
<br>
3) ShootOut   - Practice against the computer or a friend in a Five-Round 1 on 1 Shootout.  <br>
In a ShootOut, you have Five seconds to score.  If the score is tied after five rounds of <br>
alternating shots, the ShootOut will go into Sudden Death!<br>
Choosing the Calc vs Calc option will allow you to watch the Computer A.I. play itself.<br>
<br>
4) Practice   - Make up plays or just skate around and face no opposition.<br>

Two Player Info<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
----------------<br>
<br>
A Multiplayer option is available in the Exhibition and ShootOut Modes.  Make sure that <br>
both Calcs have the Hockey Files and that the Link cable is connected firmly into both <br>
Calcs and then choose the 'two player' option in either the Exhibition or ShootOut Menu.  <br>
The Calculator which Joins the game first will become the Host, which, unless you are <br>
interested in the source, really doesn't matter.  Multiplayer games have been extensively <br>
tested, but there is no way to ensure a 100% connection rate.  There is a noticeable <br>
speed difference in the multiplayer games because of the large amounts of data that need <br>
to be transferred through the link each frame.  If there is a Link Error, just try again; <br>
however, this has never happened in my tests so the link functions should be working <br>
pretty well.  It is Very fun to play Hockey with a friend!<br>
<br>
Note:  Ice Hockey 68k v2.70 (and above)'s Link code is incompatible with previous versions <br>
(changes were made to make the linkplay more optimized and stable)<br>
<br>
Note:  Currently, there is no check to make sure that both calcs have the same hockteam <br>
file, so playing multiplayer with a customized team will not work as expected.  To play <br>
multiplayer with customized teams, make sure that both calculators have the same <br>
hockteam file.<br>

HINTS and HELP<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
==============<br>
<br>
If you find Anything wrong with the game, you know a way to improve Hockey, or you are just <br>
lonely, your e-mail is very welcome.  Please, no Spam or Junk e-mails.  If you would like <br>
to reuse a major portion of the source, please contact me first.<br>

<font color="#ffcc00">
Hints:<br>
<font color="#ffffff">
-----<br>
<br>
1) Winning the Faceoffs is critical to winning the game.  Try out each of the (3) formations <br>
to see which one you do the best with.  I find that it is easier to, instead of heading <br>
straight for the puck, skate back a bit and then take the puck from whoever wins it in the <br>
scramble.<br>
<br>
2) Practice and come up with different ways to score.  One sweet way to score is to skate <br>
all of the way around the other player's goal and come out on the other side to school the <br>
goalie big time!<br>
<br>
3) On defense, if your player is behind the other team's player who controls the puck, <br>
unless they are a skinny player, the chances of them catching up are slim.  Following <br>
behind a player does nothing, so try to move your current player away from the puck so <br>
your goalie will be the closest player to the puck.  On Hard Difficulty, the Computer <br>
Players will score on your computer goalie an average of 8/10 times by aiming for the <br>
corners of the net, so taking control of your goalie to prevent a computer's <br>
'smart shot' is a must.<br>
<br>
4) Find unique ways to school players on the other team.  Maybe cut back and then skate <br>
on an angle away from a defensive player.  It's pretty sweet to play multiplayer and <br>
leave your friend in the dust.<br>
<br>
5) In ShootOuts against the Computer, I find it is easier to bring out your goalie fast, <br>
before the Computer player has the chance to get off a shot.<br>
<br>
6) The farther away you are when you pass the puck, the less accurate your pass will be.<br>
