This repository contains all of the programs and games I released for the TI family of calculators from 2000-2005 (e.g., back in the day).

All of my TI programs are also listed on <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/78/7869.html">ticalc.org</a>.

This includes a large collection of well-written / optimized TI-Basic programs (TI-83, 83+, 83+ Silver, etc.), as well as a fair number of Gameboy quality C games compiled via TIGCC (TI-89, TI-89+ Titanium Edition, 92, 92+, v200).

NOTE: these were all written before I had any format training w.r.t. software engineering and/or computer science. They are ancient and some of them even pre-date my high school years, but I used to love working on these games and really enjoyed the thriving TI programming community which taught me *a lot* when I was first starting out as a programmer -- way before I knew it would become my career.  I post the source to these games here hoping that someone like myself 10 years ago comes across them and benefits from my trials & errors, of which there were many... anyways, hopefully someone out there will find them useful.
